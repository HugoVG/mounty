# Manual

## So, always the perfect mount in any given situation!

If you are lucky and got a few mounts in your collection, then it's quite simple to name the right mount to summon in every situation. Depending on the actual circumstances you are in.

__Mounty #TLV__ offers __7 categories__ for your mounts:

- __Ground mounts__ - Mounts, which are big fun to ride, always with their feet on the ground.
- __Flying mounts__ - These can spread their wings or ignite their rockets to reach for the sky, with you on their back.
- __Dragonflight__ - Two wings, spitting fire, dead eyes and faster than the devil. Ride the dragons!
- __Water mounts__ - There are/were mounts which could walk on the water. At least there are few which are faster swimmers than others, so you don't have to hold your breath too long.
- __Repair mounts__ - You got one of these, haven't you? Or do you still have to run miles to the next anvil, to get bat to 100% durability?
- __Taxi mounts__ - A passenger's seat for a good friend is perfect for questing, farming, and fighting together hand in hand. Especially when your taxi has wings, and your friend doesn't know how to fly. He'll never forget your helping wing erm hand.
- __Show off mounts__ - You spent hours, days, weeks to get this special one, the mount of your dreams. There will never be a better one. Until tomorrow. But for now, everybody around must see: You got it!

You can assign up to __10 different favorite mounts to every category__ per drag & drop from your mount collection.

And you can assign this __one and only magic key__, which does its magic when pressed.

## The magic that happens

Via checkboxes you can decide between the following:

- _Taxi mode_ on/off: If on and you are in a group, prefer your taxi mount to summon and call for your friend to hop on.
- _Together mode_ on/off: Your winged mounts will (mostly) be ignored whilst in a party. Helpful if you joined friends, who can't fly yet and don't want to be left behind.
- _Show off mode_: Whilst in resting areas you can rest. And let others know which jelly fish, erm mounts you've got and they hopefully haven't.

### Here we go!

In the end its quite simple. When the __magic key is pressed__, it goes like this:

Are you already on a mount? Then __dismount__ and get down unless you're flying high and might fall at Hogger's feet. Then do nothing.

You were not already mounted? Then let's do the real magic and get you __the mount you crave__ for.

You just killed thousands of enemies and your durability is lower than the threshold via options? Summon your __repair mount__ and be reborn.

You hang around with friends and your _taxi mode_ is on? My friend, we call for a __taxi mount__ to ride away together. Hop on!

You are in a resting area and _show off mode_ is activated? Time to impress everyone around with one of your favorite __show off mounts__.

You're on the Dragon isles and already experienced what it is like to be storm born? Mate, its time to wake the __dragon__!

You're in a flight zone, all alone? Spread your wings or start your engines and up, up, up it goes with your favorite __fly mount__.

You're in a flight zone with friends but didn't activate _together mode_? Jump on your __fly mount__ and race the skies with your friends.

It is sad that you can't fly, and it gets worse, cause you're floating in cold water, but at least now you will summon your __water mount__ to get back to the beach asap.

None of the above did come true: Now it's time to get back to where it all started by climbing on the back of these good old __ground mounts__ and take your ride to all five horizons.

Magic done. By __Mounty #TLV__.

### The full magic in less words

>__Magic key is pressed, so now ...__\
>Are you mounted and flying -> _Do nothing_\
>Are you mounted and not flying -> _Dismount_\
>You are not mounted ...\
>Your durability is lower than xx% (see options) -> _Repair mount_\
>You are party member, _taxi mode_ is on -> _Taxi mount_\
>You are in a resting area, _show off mode_ is active -> _Show off mount_\
>You're on the Dragon isles -> _Dragon_
>You're in a flight zone, all alone -> _Fly mount_\
>You're in a flight zone with friends and _together mode_ is off -> _Fly mount_\
>You are swimming -> _Water mount_\
>else -> _Ground mount_

### But there is still more than that

__Mounty #TLV__ will choose the perfect category as described above. But there might be empty categories you didn't or couldn't assign any mount to.

In this case there is a _fallback_:

If a category is empty, it will then select one of your __flying mounts__.  And if there are none, too, it will select one of your __ground mounts__.  And if those are also missing, then there is only one last thing __Mounty #TLV__ can do for you: Randomly summon __any mount out of your whole collection__, preferring your favorites if there are any.

### Exceptions

- Exception 1: As long as you haven't given to fly yet, ground mounts will always be prefered before dragons and fly mounts.
- Exception 2: In flyable resting areas only flyable show off mounts will be chosen.

# How to configure and use

Type __/mounty in the chat__ and the options frame will open.

__Mounty #TLV__'s option frame will also open __automatically with the mount journal__ if option is not deactivated.

And __Mounty #TLV__'s option frame can be opened __by clicking a button__ in the mount journal's bottom right corner.

Drag & drop all your favorite mounts into the categories of your choice. Click right on a mount to remove it from a category.

## Options

- __Random__ - If _on_, __Mounty #TLV__ will randomly summon a mount of the selected _category_. If _off_ then it will cycle through one by one.
- __Look at me!__ - In resting areas everybody should see one of your show off mounts. Because everybody must know, that you went fishing in Zereth Mortis for hundreds of hours, just to get this one and only jelly fish.
- __Stay together__ - Whilst you are in a party: Even if you are in a flight zone and have learned to fly, you will not and stay on the ground. Looking for any reason? If you joined a friend who can't fly yet and you want to help him progress, farm, or quest, then it's quite fair to stay with him and keep eye level. Except ...
- __Taxi mode__ - You want to help a friend and give him some rides whilst questing and farming together, then turn this on. When in a party and you summon your mount, your taxi mount will arrive. Where to?
- __How to call ...__ - Say it! When your taxi arrives this short line of text will be chatted, so your friend will hop on and not let you wait. (Only if in group)
- __Durability threshold__ - When your durability is lower than this, there's always a big hand for summoning your repair mount first. It's another kind of magic.
- __Debug mode__ - Magic in numbers and letters. See for yourself what __Mounty #TLV__ let's you know via chat messages.

## Binding keys

__Use _system key bindings_ to assign your magic key.__

Besides the _magic key_ you can also bind some _special keys_ to summon a mount of a category of your choice. No magic then, but pure free will.

For example, my config is like this:

- \# -> _Magic key_
- CTRL-# -> _Repair mount_
- SHIFT-# -> _Taxi mount_
- ALT-# -> _Water mount_
- CTRL-ALT-# -> _Ground mount_
- CTRL-Space -> _Show off mount_
