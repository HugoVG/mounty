# The magic of Mounty #TLV

You are in a flight zone, swimming in the water or joined by a friend, who can't fly jet?\
You want to ride on, but your armor is low and you should repair asap?\
You want to show off with these awesome mounts, which nobody else has got (except, everybody got it;)?\
You got some favorite mounts for all these occasions and just want to be surprised, which mount will summon next?

All this can be done with __Mounty #TLV__ and all this will happen _magically_ with just __1 single key__ pressed.

# What it does

## Always the perfect mount in any given situation!

If you are lucky and got a few mounts in your collection, then it's quite simple to name the right mount to summon in every situation. Depending on the actual circumstances you are in.

__Mounty #TLV__ offers __6 categories__ for your mounts:

- __Ground mounts__ - Mounts, which are big fun to ride, always with their feet on the ground.\
- __Flying mounts__ - These can spread their wings or ignite their rockets to reach for the sky, with you on their back.\
- __Water mounts__ - There are/were mounts which could walk on the water. At least there are few which are faster swimmers than others, so you don't have to hold your breath too long.\
- __Repair mounts__ - You got one of these, haven't you? Or do you still have to run miles to the next anvil, to get bat to 100% durability?\
- __Taxi mounts__ - A passenger's seat for a good friend is perfect for questing, farming, and fighting together hand in hand. Especially when your taxi has wings, and your friend doesn't know how to fly. He'll never forget your helping wing erm hand.\
- __Show off mounts__ - You spent hours, days, weeks to get this special one, the mount of your dreams. There will never be a better one. Until tomorrow. But for now, everybody around must see: You got it!

You can assign up to __10 different favorite mounts to every category__ per drag & drop from your mount collection.

And you can assign this __one and only magic key__, which does its magic when pressed.

## The magic that happens

Via checkboxes you can decide between the following:

- _Taxi mode_ on/off: If on and you are in a group, prefer your taxi mount to summon and call for your friend to hop on.\
- _Don't fly mode_ on/off: Your winged mounts will (mostly) be ignored. Helpful if you joined friends, who can't fly yet and don't want to be left behind.

In the end its quite simple. When the __magic key is pressed__, it goes like this:

Are you already on a mount? Then __dismount__ and get down unless you're flying high and might fall at Hogger's feet. Then do nothing.

You we're not already mounted? Then let's do the real magic and get you __the mount you crave__ for.

You just killed thousands of enemies and your durability is lower than the threshold via options? Summon your __repair mount__ and be reborn.

You are in a resting area and no member of any party? Time to impress everyone around with one of your favorite __show off mounts__.

You are in this resting area, but member of a party of friends and your _taxi mode_ is off? Right, we __show off__, too.

You are member of a party of friends and your _taxi mode_ is on? My friend, we call for a __taxi mount__ to ride away together. Hop on!

You're in a flight zone and didn't deactivate flying via _don't fly mode_? Spread your wings or start your engines and up, up, up it goes with your favorite __fly mount__.

So sad you can't fly and even harder that you're swimming in cold water, but at least now you will summon your __water mount__ to get back to the beach asap.

None of the above did come true: Now it's time to get back to where it all started by climbing on the back of these good old __ground mounts__ and take your ride to all five horizons.

Magic done. By __Mounty #TLV__.

## The full magic in less words
```
Magic key is pressed ->
Are you mounted and flying -> Do nothing
Are you mounted and not flying -> Dismount
You are not mounted ->
Your durability is lower than xx% (see options) -> Repair mount
You are single in a resting area -> Show off mount
You are party member in a resting area, taxi mode is off -> Show off mount
You are party member, taxi mode is on -> Taxi mount
You are in a flight zone and don't fly mode is off -> Fly mount
You can't fly and are swimming -> Water mount
else -> Ground mount
```
## But there is still more than that

__Mounty #TLV__ will choose the perfect category as described above. But there might be empty categories you didn't or couldn't assign any mount to.

In this case there is a _fallback_:

If a category is empty, it will then select one of your __flying mounts__.  And if there are none, too, it will select one of your __ground mounts__.  And if those are also missing, then there is only one last thing __Mounty #TLV__ can do for you: Randomly summon __any mount out of your whole collection__, preferring your favorites if there are any. 

# How to configure and use

__Type _/mounty_ in the chat and the options frame will open.__

Drag & drop all your favorite mounts into the categories of your choice. Click right on a mount to remove it from a category.

## Options

__Random__ - If _on_, __Mounty #TLV__ will randomly summon a mount of the selected _category_. If _off_ then it will cycle through one by one.\
__Don't fly__ - Even if you are in a flight zone and have learned to fly, you will not and stay on the ground. Looking for any reason? If you joined a friend who can't fly yet and you want to help him progress, farm, or quest, then it's quite fair to stay with him and keep eye level. Except ...\
__Taxi mode__ - You want to help a friend and give him some rides whilst questing and farming together, then turn this on. When in a party and you summon your mount, your taxi mount will arrive. Where to?\
__How to call ...__ - When your taxi arrives shout, erm speak out this short line of text, so your friend won't let you wait.\
__Durability threshold__ - When your durability is lower than this, there's always a big hand for summoning your repair mount first. It's another kind of magic.\
__Debug mode__ - Magic in numbers and letters. See for yourself what __Mounty #TLV__ let's you know via chat messages.

## Binding keys

__Use _system key bindings_ to assign your magic key.__

You can also bind some special key to summon a mount of a category of your choice. No magic than, but pure free will.

For example, my config is like this:

\# -> _Magic key_\
CTRL-# -> _Repair mount_\
SHIFT-# -> _Taxi mount_\
ALT-# -> _Water mount_\
CTRL-Space -> _Show off mount_
