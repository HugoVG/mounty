##Magic
You are in a flight zone, swimming in the water or joined by a friend, who can't fly jet?
You wanna ride on, but your armor is low and you should repair asap?
You wanna show of with these awesome mounts, which nobody else has got (except, everybody got it;)?
You got some favourite mounts for all these occsions and just want to be surprised, which mount will summon next?

All this can be done with __Mounty #TLV__ and all this will happen _magically_ with just __1 single key__ pressed.

##How to use
A detailed description is in the making, since then just try to figure it out by yourself:

/mounty will open the option window
Use system key bindings to assign your magic key/s

##Coming soon
